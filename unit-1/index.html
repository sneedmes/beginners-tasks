        <p>Before Christopher Nolan dabbled in atomic physics for Oppenheimer, he tapped into the depths of black holes and astrophysics for Interstellar. Nolan’s timeless space epic delves into a space crew’s efforts at finding a new planet as Earth becomes uninhabitable. Interstellar doesn’t shy away from its science-heavy themes, but the narrative also makes room for a genuinely emotional tale between a father-daughter duo separated by the fabric of space and time. With Matthew McConaughey’s teary-eyed monologues and Hans Zimmer’s atmospheric score, Interstellar is rightly regarded among the finest works of philosophical sci-fi alongside classics like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solaris.
            While a few critics were initially put off by the movie’s primary emphasis on scientific accuracy, Interstellar’s acclaim has only increased in the years since its 2014 release. The importance given to real-life theoretical physics doesn’t just stem from Nolan’s own fascination with the subject but also the educational qualifications of his collaborators, ranging from scientific consultant Kip Thorne and his brother and Interstellar co-screenwriter Jonathan Nolan. The movie garnered such a respectable status among the scientific community that even physicist and television personality Neil deGrasse Tyson has been in total awe of Nolan’s vision. A space movie indeed never felt this realistic before</p>
